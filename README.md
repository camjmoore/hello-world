my first repository

OccludedArp here, my name refers to the the hidden (occluded) music-like patterning (arpeggio) that pervades the phenomena of the world -I am interested in organic mimicry and drawing inspiration from natural systems. I am most fascinated by languages like puredata, processing and three.js!
